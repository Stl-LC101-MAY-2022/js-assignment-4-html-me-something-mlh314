                  It's just one of the best cities in the world. Los Angeles undoubtedly has the most celebrities passing in and out of it compared to any and every city that comes to mind. 
                 Los Angeles is one of the best cities for shopping and fashion lovers because it has dozens of malls and shopping districts to suit every budget and style. 
                 LA is a great area to do some hiking, There are tons of hiking trails throughout Los Angeles. Most of all I would love to visit many of the settings that I've seen on movies and videos and emerge myself with a real life experience.

                  New York is a Top 3 city in this realm. I want to just have a month straight to have the opportunity to do as much discovering of this mammoth of a city. From the diversity of food options, museums, parks, shopping malls, etc.
                  NYC transit system is thee most insane complex transportation unit I've heard. NYC simply is just unmatched!

                  I haven't quite yet traveled outside of the country, I've recently just got my passport and the first international destination I would visit is Kingston, Jamaica without question. 
                  It's the islands capital
